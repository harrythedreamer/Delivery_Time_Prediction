# Delivery Time Prediction

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and resources for a Delivery Time Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the delivery time for orders based on various features and conditions.

**Project Structure**

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Working with Pycaret
- Finding the best model with Pycaret
- Making prediction with Pycaret
5. Predicting with LightGBM Model (Manually Built)
- Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: train data and predict data
- Building and Fine-Tuning LightGBM Model
- Making prediction

**Dataset**

- **train.csv** - the full dataset for training purpose
- **predict.csv** - new dataset for making prediction (withour the target column)
