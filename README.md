# Delivery Time Prediction

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and resources for a Delivery Time Prediction project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the delivery time for orders based on various features and conditions.

**Project Structure**

_1. Data Cleaning

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

3. Working with Pycaret

3.1 Finding the best model with Pycaret

3.2 Making prediction with Pycaret

4. Predicting with LightGBM Model (Manually Built)

4.1 Building and Fine-Tuning LightGBM Model

4.2 Making prediction_

**Dataset**

**train.csv** - the full dataset for training purpose
**predict.csv** - new dataset for making prediction (withour the target column)
